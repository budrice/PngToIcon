# PngToIcon
Needed an icon and didn't want to use some web app...

Console app for converting a .png to .ico.<br>
Filepath format: C:\folder_to_png<br>
The path does not end with bracket as this is made to copy and paste from file explorer.<br>
Filenames for the .png and the .ico do not use file extentions.<br>
